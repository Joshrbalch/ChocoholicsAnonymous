  <h2>Coupling and Cohesion Analysis</h2>
  <p>
  Chocoholics Anonymous is an organization that is responsible for assisting those who are addicted to chocolate. In order to maintain a reliable user<br>
  interface system, the design team must ensure that strict programming standards are followed. The ideas surrounding coupling and cohesion are not<br>
  exceptions to the standards. The aim of the system is to follow the conventions of low coupling and high cohesion. Our system build utilizes a high <br>
  separation of classes yet has easy-to-follow communication between them. This not only makes our system simpler to design, but also to understand from an<br>
  outside perspective and perform maintenance on. This structure is good because it avoids entanglement between classes and dependencies that are unwanted. <br>
  It also allows for modification of the system in a direct and targeted fashion, reducing time spent on secondary fixes after changes are made. Overall,<br>
  this system has been designed in such a way that it follows “good” software design practices<br>
