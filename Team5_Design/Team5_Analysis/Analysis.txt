As the leading chocolate rehab organization, Chocoholics Anonymous needs to keep up with 
constant technological advances, the organization will computerize sections of its operations
to make it more efficient. The computerized sections include member records, financial transactions, 
and scheduling. The data will be stored in a secure database to ensure its safety and accessibility.
To support the computerization, the organization will require a desktop or laptop computer,
internet connection, and printer. The system will interact with other systems
such as insurance providers, medical professionals, and billing systems.
Users, including members and employees, will interact with the system through a user-friendly
interface that allows for easy access to information and communications.
