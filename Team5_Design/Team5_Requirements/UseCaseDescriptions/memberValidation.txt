Use Case: Validating Member
Context: When a member comes into a provider, they must be validated as a ChocAn member before receiving services
Actors: Provider
Main Success Scenario:
    1.  Provider selects Member Validation on the provider menu on the terminal
    2.  The system prompts the provider to slide the membership card through the terminal 
    3.	Provider receives member’s membership card and slides it through the card reader on the terminal
    4.	The system then connects with the ChocAn Data Center where they then check the member number
        4.1 The data center returns the status of the member
    5.	The Terminal then displays the status of the member
    6.	The system returns to provider menu
Extensions:
    5a. If the member number is Valid, 
        5a.1. the terminal will then display the word “Validated”
    5b. If the number is not valid,
        5b.1. The number is nonexistent, the system will display the words “Invalid Number”
        5b.2. The member owes fees (for at least a month) and their status has been set to suspended, the system will display the words “Member Suspended”
