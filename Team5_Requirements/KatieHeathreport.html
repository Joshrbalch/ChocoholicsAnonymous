            <h2>Written Solution</h2>
            <p>We are creating software for ChocAn, a company that specializes in helping Chocoholics (people addicted to chocolate) get support from  doctors, dietitians <br>
            and exercise experts. The task of putting together a glossary was done by Evan McCuller. The following tasks presented to us were to identify the different use <br>
            cases and draw ULM diagrams for each image. The next task was to write a Use Case Description of the use cases we had found and put them into the Report.html. <br>
            How we broke this up was by all selecting one or more use cases, and doing both the diagram and description for the selected case. Brodye Stevens put together <br>
            the description and diagram for Billing Service, Banking and Disk Recording  use cases, his diagram can be found under Billing Service.png. Evan McCullar, as well <br>
            as doing the glossary, worked on the Interactive mode use case, the diagram for which can be found under EvanMcCullar (1).png.  Liam Kelly put together the <br>
            Service Code Lookup diagram and description as well as the Manager Report.  Michael Orscheln did the use case diagram for Provider directory, which can be found <br>
            under MichaelUseCaseDiagram.png.  Katie Heath worked on the Main Accounting Procedure and wrote the solution. Josh Balch was the submitter for the Report.html as well as<br>
            put together the use case diagram and description for Member Validation. Which can be found under memberValidationUseCaseDiagram.png. </p>
