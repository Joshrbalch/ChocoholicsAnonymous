Use case: Directory Use Case
Context: Provider uses Provider Directory to look up appropriate 6-digit service code for correct service. Provider inputs code. To check if code is correct, the terminal displays the name of service (20 chars) and provider has to verify it is the correct service. If provider has entered incorrect code/nonexisent code, an error message is printed
Actors: Provider

(3) Ask provider to verify if name is correct service
