Use Case: Validating Member
Context: When a member comes into a provider, they must be validated as a ChocAn member before receiving services
Actors: Provider
Main Success Scenario:
    1.	Provider receives member’s membership card and slides it through the card reader on the terminal
    2.	The terminal then connects with the ChocAn Data Center where they then check the member number
    3.	The Terminal then displays the status of the member
    4.	The system returns to menu
Extensions:
    3a. If the member number is Valid, 
        3a.1. the terminal will then display the word “Validated”
    3b. If the number is not valid,
        3b.1. The number is nonexistent, the system will display the words “Invalid Number”
        3b.2. The member owes fees (for at least a month) and their status has been set to suspended, the system will display the words “Member Suspended”
